# Index

Hi! This is the [[knowledge garden]] of [[Wentao Li]], built with [Silverbullet](https://silverbullet.md), containing my notes on [[physics]], [[math]] and [[computer-science]].

## Usage

The current page is [[index]], click the house icon on the upper right corner to get back here. You can search for pages via `Cmd-K` (`Ctrl-K` for Windows), or via clicking the page icon. Full text search is available via `Cmd-Shift-F` (`Ctrl-Shift-F` for Windows). 

Pages are organized by tags instead of folders. A complete list of tags is available below. For each `tag`, there is a page called `tag` which lists the pages tagged with `tag`. For example, if you want to take a look at my notes related to algebra, just go to [[math/algebra]].

${query[[from index.tag "tag" where name:startsWith("meta") == false select name]]}

Start wherever you like and click around, but keep in mind you can always search for stuff.

## Background

The page [[knowledge garden]] explains the motivation behind this knowledge garden.
