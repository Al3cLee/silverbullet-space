# Index

Hi! This is the [[knowledge garden]] of [[Wentao Li]], built with [Silverbullet](https://silverbullet.md), containing my notes on [[physics]], [[math]] and [[computer-science]]. After the initial loading (which might take a little while) this website will remain available _even without internet connection_.

## Usage

The current page is [[index]], click the “house” icon on the upper right corner to get back here. You can search for pages via `Cmd-K` (`Ctrl-K` for Windows), or via clicking the “page” icon. Full text search is available via `Cmd-Shift-F` (`Ctrl-Shift-F` for Windows).

Pages are organized by tags instead of folders. A complete list of tags is available below. For each `<tag>`, there is a page called `<tag>` which serves as its table of contents, i.e. lists all of its relevant pages and sub-tags.

${query[[from index.tag "tag" where name:startsWith("meta") == false select name]]}

Start wherever you like and click around, but keep in mind you can always search for stuff.

## Background

The page [[knowledge garden]] explains the motivation.
