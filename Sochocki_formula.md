# The Sochocki Formula

When integrating a “one over _z_” term, it is customary in complex analysis to add a infinitely small imaginary part to the denominator. After evaluating the integral with this small imaginary part (usually using the residue theorem), we use the so-called Sochocki formula to convert it back to an integral on the real axis.
