Here lists the pages that are not finished yet. Having metadata `finished=true` does not mean a page will not be further edited (after all, in principle every page would be updated continuously), but having metadata `finished=false` means it definitely needs editing, which usually means I have some floating thoughts yet to be pinned down to notes.

${template.each(query[[from index.tag "page" where finished == false]], templates.pageItem)}
