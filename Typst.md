# Typst

A blazingly fast markup language powered with scripting. It has [an open-source compiler](https://scfp.jinguo-group.science/) (which is under 20MB, by the way), a very responsive VS Code extension, and a collaborative web app that charges for pro features. I heard about it several times but never took it seriously until I found [a splendid Julia programming book](https://scfp.jinguo-group.science/) for physicists written and hosted using Typst and its ecosystem.

Being fluent in LaTeX I set up Typst and learned its scripting in two days, and wrote this note with Typst: ${pdfPath("typst_intro")}
