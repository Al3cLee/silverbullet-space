# Technical Note

By “technical” we refer to notes which require a certain amount of technical knowledge to work through and then understand, as opposed to notes which are merely quotes and comments. Technical notes are often written by hand first and then typeset, while shallower notes are often typed in the first place. For subjects like physics and mathematics almost all notes are technical.

Technical notes investigate a topic in detail. This can be re-framed into “asking relevant questions concerning a topic, and then answering them in detail”. There could be multiple iterations of this Q&A process within a single piece of note. 

I usually start a technical note with motivation paragraphs, establishing the context against which the question to be considered is set. 

Then I would go on to discuss the question raised in the motivation paragraph in detail. In mathematics this is often organized in a “claim-proof” structure, but in other fields it is hard to categorize everything in the discussions as “proof” because qualitative arguments (which are not formally rigorous) and analogies are often invoked.

Therefore I do not like to write down the word “proof” explicitly before starting the discussion. After the motivation paragraph I simply let my inner dialogue run riot.

When the discussion yields some result I would explicitly write down a result paragraph. For math notes it is typically a theorem; for physics this paragraph is simply the summary of a result, which _could_ include qualitative descriptions.

After arriving at a result I take time to reflect on the Q&A session and make remarks. Remarks can also be qualitative arguments which, without understanding technical details, are hard to appreciate.

To sum up, a typical technical note consists of

1. motivation,
2. discussion,
3. results, and
4. remarks

In the context of Q&A, the motivation paragraph raises a question, the discussion and result sections answer it, and then the remark section reflects upon this Q&A process. 

In this knowledge garden, technical notes are usually structured as above, but the different parts may not be marked explicitly by a title (e.g. `## Motivation`). Instead, horizontal rules are inserted between different stages of narration, while titles indicate topics.
