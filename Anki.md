# Anki

An open-source spaced repetition application that 

* supports multiple formats, including images, audio and LaTeX equations
* provides a free cloud-sync account and
* can talk to other tools via Ankiconnect.

For a detailed discussion of the spaced repetition concept as well as Anki use cases, see [this blog post](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) by [Michael Nielsen](https://michaelnotebook.com), and his other [writings on memory](https://michaelnotebook.com/tag/memory.html).

## Plugins

* [Markdown plugin](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2100166052) so that Anki notes can be taken in plain text and rendered in Anki as markdown. Without it one would have to use the GUI buttons for indentation, code blocks and itemize.
* [Ankiconnet](https://github.com/amikey/anki-connect) is a must-have (talking to Logseq and Goldendict)

## The need for long-form notes

Now that we have Anki to help us remember things, does this mean we can actually take notes inside Anki and feel safe ever after, without needing traditional long-form notes?

I don’t think so, because 

* Anki does not offer long-form presentation of content. As Mr. Nielsen points out, a best practice of Anki usage is making the cards as atomized as possible. Without the long-form reading experience, reviewing is too fragmented;
* Anki does not allow one to build a [[knowledge_garden]] of any kind;
* Anki cards or decks are not good for sending to others because the bits that tick with one’s memory may not tick with others. They can be exported and sent, though.
