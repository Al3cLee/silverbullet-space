This is the repository for my knowledge garden, created with  [Silverbullet](https://silverbullet.md/). The recommended way to access this knowledge garden is via `https://wentaoli.xyz`, where a read-only instance of this garden is hosted.

Alternatively, you can also access this knowledge garden off-line. This repository itself is a “[silverbullet space](https://silverbullet.md/Spaces)”, so cloning it to your local `<path>` (or, if you don’t want to use Git, downloading it to `<path>` from Releases) and running Silverbullet v2 on `<path>` will initiate a locally available web-app interface at `localhost:<port>` where `<port>` can be specified when you run Silverbullet. 

For details about installing Silverbullet and running it, see its documentation on [installation](https://silverbullet.md/Install/Binary) and [configuration](https://silverbullet.md/Install/Configuration). To provide a minimal example: if you have this repository at `<your-folder>` and installed the Silverbullet binary at `<your-path-to-silverbullet>`, then running 

```bash
SB_PORT=3000 <your-path-to-silverbullet> <your-folder>
```

and opening `localhost:3000` should give you an editable instance of the same knowledge garden as the one at `https://wentaoli.xyz`.
