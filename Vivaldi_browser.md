# Vivaldi browser

The Vivaldi browser is a cross-platform, Chromium-based browser with a [proprietary](https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/why-isnt-vivaldi-browser-open-source/) yet immensely powerful user interface. (Note that only the UI layer is proprietary.)

Some of its most appealing features are

* [**Quick commands.**](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/shortcuts/quick-commands/)  An in-browser command palette that allows customization of [command chains](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/shortcuts/command-chains/), like a Spotlight or Raycast dedicated only for the browser.
* [**Workspaces.**](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/tabs/workspaces/) Arrange tabs into workspaces, e.g. “news”, “work” and “social” so each part of your browsing gets a dedicates space. The workspaces “rules” feature is especially helpful: visit `vivaldi:settings`, search for “workspace”, and add your own rules like “put all tags whose path contains `reddit` into the workspace Social”. Click around and Vivaldi sorts out the workspaces for you.
